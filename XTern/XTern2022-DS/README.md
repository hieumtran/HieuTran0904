XTern Data Science assessment test

## Clean and organize your data set then present the data as a table or data frame. 
Using Google API key, Evenbrite API key, and web scrapping method (requests, BeautifulSoup4), I have successfully gathered the neccessary data for this project. The ``event_after_preprocessing.csv`` is for the Evenbrite events after brief pre-processing. The ``conference`` and ``restaurant`` folder contains the nearest local conference and restaurant within 15 miles, corresponding to the location given in the ``data.xlsx`` in my ``data`` folder. The nearest conference and restaurant data are gathered via google API and save as table as ``.csv`` file. The event are gathered via web srapping and Eventbrite API under ``.csv`` format.

## Cluster housing, restaurants, event, conference locations to pick out the most convenient coworking space. 
Using the time travel data from Google API, I successfully have the location with the shortest distance and time travel. The shortest time travel is the most conveninient place, given the coworking location. Time is important. Therefore, if a worker at the cowrking space, I can use this data to give them the approximate time travel for preference

## Review the data and draw any conclusions you can find from the data set you gathered. 
From my data, I review the nearest conferences, restaurants, and events. A lot of events is virtual and have the spread through a lot of weeks. The price is not really expensive with the mean is from 3.5, which is pretty cheap and time travel is pretty short. Therefore, Indianapolis has many restaurants and conferences to spend time and have fun. 

## Present a sample 10-week activities plan with event date, event location and event detail. 
Based on the time and travel, a person can choose more plans to enjoy. However, a sample 10-week is impossible because the events can change through time. The current data cannot give a clear plan. Therefore, we will need another dataset with 10-week events in advance on the Evenbrite. For example, we can use web scrapping to gather all events on Eventbrite 10 weeks from now. Therefore, our analysis will be more valuable.  


## Demonstrate your findings using data visualization tools and well written analysis.
Due to time constraint, I was not able to visualize my data. Therefore, 

## Final words
For future reference, I can perform more analysis, given more time. For example, I have the idea of the analysis and can gather more data if neccessary. Using API for the first time is a great experiment for me. I learn a lot after this assessment test. Thank you XTern Team
