Welcome to MLANNS's documentation!
==================================

This documentation is my diary on statistical learning (machine learning) and artificial neural network (ANNs).
I will constantly update and update my knowledge within this domain everyday.
For constistency purpose, I will follow mostly in `Introduction to statistical learning <https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ff2adbe3fe4fe33db902812/t/6009dd9fa7bc363aa822d2c7/1611259312432/ISLR+Seventh+Printing.pdf>`_.
I will also include various good resources to improve this respository
